Technical Story: Deciding on the scope of the proof of concept

## Context and Problem Statement

I need to choose how much of the project brief I am covering with my proof of concept

## Decision Drivers

* Time taken
* Showcase of features

## Considered Options

* Full functionallity
* Partial Functionality
* Core Functionaliity

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Partial Functionality", because Can focus on showing the client what the solution could look like when fully implemented. It would also allow the client to give feedback on the solution and recomend improvements

### Positive Consequences

* Allows the client to get an idea of how the solution will look when it is completed
* Helps the client to give feedback in the development process

### Negative Consequences

* I will need to make a frontend for the project

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Full functionallity

A full application with all of the requirements filled

* Good, because Its a full implementation, meaning the client would be able to give more thorough feedback
* Bad, because Too Large a scope. If I were to make a full implementation, it would not be a proof of concept
* Bad, because Time investment, the time investment for making the app full functionality would be too high for a proof of cocept

### Partial Functionality

A frontend and a backend with only the most important functionallity (complaints system, login, role chaning)

* Good, because Allows the client to get an idea of how the solution will look when it is completed
* Good, because Helps the client to give feedback in the development process
* Bad, because Client might expect a bit more from a proof of concept

### Core Functionaliity

Same functionality as a partial implementation, however there is no frontend and only an API

* Good, because Allows the client to get an idea of how the solution will look when it is completed
* Good, because Can focus on making it easy for people to integrate with our system.
* Good, because Quicker to make than a patial implementation as there is no need for a frontend
* Bad, because Client will need some technical knowlege and need to use their imagination for how a frontend could look like
* Bad, because Clients will have to make their own implementaiton of our api if we do not make our own later
