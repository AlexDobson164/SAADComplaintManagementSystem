Technical Story: I need to choose what backend technology to use

## Context and Problem Statement

To develop a Complaint Management System I will need to develop a backend to handle the logic, this means that I need to decide the technology I will use.

## Decision Drivers

* Previous Experience
* Ease of use
* Long Term Support

## Considered Options

* .NET
* Node.js

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: ".NET", because I have experience developing applications in .NET and I do not have much experience developing applications with Node.js, meaning I would need to spend a significant amount of time to learn it. I also prefer to write code in C#

### Positive Consequences

* I am more experienced with .Net and c#, increasing development speed

### Negative Consequences

* smaller pool of developers

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### .NET

An open source framework developed by Microsoft.

* Good, because One of the languages that it uses is C#. I have been using C# since I started university and also used it on placement meaning that it is the language I have the most experience using.
* Good, because C# is a very popular language and has been around for 25 years, this means that it would not be hard to find developers for the project
* Bad, because Each version of .NET is only supported for about 2-3 years, meaning that the solution will need to update to new versions. (see table on linked Wikipedia page)

### Node.js

Node.js is a framework that allows you to use JavaScript to write backend code

* Good, because Need to write JavaScript code anyway for the frontend. So we could also use it for backend, this means that developers will not need to learn as many languages
* Good, because JS is used much more than C# according to statista (linked in links)
* Bad, because Short support for versions. Node.js releases new versions very often but by looking at its releases (I have attached a link in links), we can see that some of the more recent versions have not even been supported for a year.
